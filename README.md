# Glee extension.

## Overview

Hii! I made this small extension for self entertainment and refreshment. Sometimes while coding, it could become monotonous and you might look for a small break. Same used to happen with me. But that break sometimes became infinite browsing and scrolling through other pages. So, I came up with the idea to display a joke through an extension on the same page, so that you don't get lost in the outside world and your main activity is still your main activity. On top of that, you can always read some good joke!! One of them has stayed with me for long now:

**Where was the Declaration of Independence signed? At the bottom!**
